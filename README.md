# 🌍 Web Project — Inspired by Robeurope.com

This project represents a personal **web development exercise**, inspired by the design and structure of [Robeurope.com](https://www.robeurope.com).  
The main goal is to improve my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, experimenting with structure, style, and responsive design techniques.  

The project is in **gradual growth** and will continue to evolve until the **final submission on December 3rd, 2025**.
